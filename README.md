======

Deplot is a ruby gem to easily create and manage a static web site.

Development

The `rubygem` branch â€“ an attempt to make `deplot` into a rails-like gem - is still under development. Though this is a working gem, you will need to manually build and install the gem. Also, much of the functionality is not yet implemented.
