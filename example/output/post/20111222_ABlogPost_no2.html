<p>Inspired by Sinatra&#39;s simplicity and ease of use, Frank lets you build static sites using your favorite libs. Frank has a built in development server for previewing work as you develop, an &quot;export&quot; command for compiling and saving your work out to static html and css, and a publish command for copying your exported pages to a server.</p>

<p>Frank uses Tilt, so it comes with support for Haml &amp; Sass, LESS, Builder, ERB, and Liquid.</p>
