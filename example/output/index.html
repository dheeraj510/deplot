		<h3>Blog post no. 3</h3>

<p>Frank (as of 1.0) has support for saving &quot;templates&quot; in <code>~/.frank_templates</code>. This is very handy if find yourself wanting a custom starting point. All you have to do to use the feature is create a <code>~/.frank_templates</code> folder and start putting templates in it.</p>

<p>Once you have a few templates saved, when you run <code>frank new &lt;project_path&gt;</code> you&#39;ll be presented with a list of templates to choose from as the starting point for the project.</p>

<p>Frank was designed to make controllers unnecessary. But, sometimes it&#39;s nice to have
variables in your templates / layouts. This is particularly handy if you want to set the page
title (in the layout) according to the view. This is simple, now, with meta data.</p>

<p>Meta fields go at the top of any view, and are written in [YAML][13]. To mark the end
of the meta section, place the meta delimeter, <code>META---</code>, on a blank line. You can
use as many hyphens as you&#39;d like (as long as there are 3).</p>

<p>Meta fields are then available as local variables to all templating languages that
support them--in the view &amp; layout.</p>

<p>Inspired by Sinatra&#39;s simplicity and ease of use, Frank lets you build static sites using your favorite libs. Frank has a built in development server for previewing work as you develop, an &quot;export&quot; command for compiling and saving your work out to static html and css, and a publish command for copying your exported pages to a server.</p>

<p>Frank uses Tilt, so it comes with support for Haml &amp; Sass, LESS, Builder, ERB, and Liquid.</p>

		<h3>Blog post no. 1</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
