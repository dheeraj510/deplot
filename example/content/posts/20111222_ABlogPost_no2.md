### Blog post no. 2

Inspired by Sinatra's simplicity and ease of use, Frank lets you build static sites using your favorite libs. Frank has a built in development server for previewing work as you develop, an "export" command for compiling and saving your work out to static html and css, and a publish command for copying your exported pages to a server.

Frank uses Tilt, so it comes with support for Haml & Sass, LESS, Builder, ERB, and Liquid.
